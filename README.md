# Drupal Rekognition 7  

This module uses AWS Rekognition to summarize images that are uploaded. Currently, it is implemented with a custom content type; however, future versions will natively support the Media module in Drupal 7.  

A version for Drupal 8 is coming soon. This readme will be updated once that version has been release.
